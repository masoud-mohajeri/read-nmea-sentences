![what is NMEA](https://www.nmea.org/Assets/NMEA%200183%20with%20wires.jpg)

NMEA 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronics
such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer, gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of 
instruments. It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the National Marine Electronics Association.
It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and NMEA 0182 standards. In leisure marine applications it is slowly
being phased out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard , though NMEA0183 remains the norm
in commercial shipping.
